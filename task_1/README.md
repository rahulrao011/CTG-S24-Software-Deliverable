In the data directory there are csv files named by their stock market ticker symbol (for example Apple Inc. corresponds to AAPL.csv).

These csv files are organized by dates, which are the index on the left-hand side (these dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format) (all of the stocks have the same dates).

Additionally each column (labeled on the top) represents a different metric for this particular stock (high, low, open, close, etc.) (all of the stocks have the same metrics).

I did not experience any issues with this task.
